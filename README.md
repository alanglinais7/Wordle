# Wordle
A python implementation of Wordle

This game is a knock off of the popular Wordle game found here (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)

However, in this version you can pick the difficulty by selecting the amount of letters in the word as well as the amount of guesses that you'll recieve.

The words are chosen from a word bank of 100k words generated here (https://onlinerandomtools.com/generate-random-csv). You can add or remove this file, but the length of the word needs to be stored in the second column.

When you guess the word, if a letter is in the word in the right spot it will be highlighted in green. If the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot, it'll be yellow.

At the end of the game you'll recieve your score, as well as statisctics on how well you've done in the past (for the same difficulty).

To run this game, make sure all of the files are in the same directory, navigate to the folder in your terminal and type, 'python3 wordle.py'
